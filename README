==================================================

Build Instructions
--------------------------------------------------
The folder structure of this repository mirrors a standard Magento community edition install.  To build individual modules, simply run to the bash build scripts located at the root of the project

	$ cd /path/to/checkout
	$ ./build_developer_manual.bash
	
After running, you'll find a tar archive in the

	var/build/
	
folder.  This archive is **not** a Magento Connect module.  Rather, it's an archive that contains all the files you'll need to manually install in your system.	

Included Modules
--------------------------------------------------

###Layout Unremove

The Layout Unremove module allows you to, via Layout Update XML scripts, undo the effects of a previously executed &lt;remove/&gt; tag.
